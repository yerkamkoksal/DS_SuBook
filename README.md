# SUBook Social Media Simulation

## Overview
This C++ project, titled `SUBook`, is a simulation of a basic social media platform. It features three main classes: `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`, each encapsulating functionalities typical of social media interactions.

### Key Features:
- `User` class allows creating users with unique names and tracks the number of comments made by each user.
- `Post` class enables users to create posts and add comments to these posts.
- `Comment` class facilitates adding comments to posts, linked to both the user and the post.

## Structure
The project is divided into two main files:
1. `SUBook.h`: The header file contains the declarations of the `User`, `Post`, and `Comment` classes along with their respective attributes and methods.
2. Main C++ file (name not provided): Implements the functionalities of the `SUBook` classes, including creating users and posts, adding comments, and displaying post details.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Basic knowledge of terminal or command prompt usage

### Compiling and Running the Code
To compile and run the project, use the following command in a terminal or command prompt where your C++ compiler is accessible:

```bash
g++ [main_file_name].cpp -o SUBook
./SUBook
Replace [main_file_name] with the name of your main C++ file.

#Usage

After running the executable, the program simulates social media interactions, allowing the creation of users and posts, and adding comments to these posts.
