# SUBook Social Media Simulation

## Overview
This C++ project, titled `SUBook`, is a simulation of a basic social media platform. It features three main classes: `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`, each encapsulating functionalities typical of social media interactions.

### Key Features:
- `User` class allows creating users with unique names and tracks the number of comments made by each user.
- `Post` class enables users to create posts and add comments to these posts.
- `Comment` class facilitates adding comments to posts, linked to both the user and the post.

## Structure
The project is divided into two main files:
1. `SUBook.h`: The header file contains the declarations of the `User`, `Post`, and `Comment` classes along with their respective attributes and methods.
2. Main C++ file (name not provided): Implements the functionalities of the `SUBook` classes, including creating users and posts, adding comments, and displaying post details.
